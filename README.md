The cleaned and enhanced dataset is then loaded into a PostgreSQL database, making it ready for advanced analytics, business intelligence, and data-driven decision-making.

### Dataset Information
- **Source File:** **customer_shopping_behavior.csv**
- **Total Records:** 3,900 customer transactions
- **Original Features:** 18 columns covering demographics, purchase details, and behavioral patterns
- **Final Features:** 19 columns (after feature engineering)

## Project Workflow
### 1. Environment Setup
The project utilizes Python with key data science libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and SQLAlchemy with psycopg2 for database connectivity.

### 2. Data Loading & Initial Exploration
